yet another Backbone.js Boilerplate

this is the sort of app structure I would usually start off a Backbone
based project. Have a look, there are base views, tests etc.

Also let me know if you find anything that bugs you or maybe something
that could be added.

## Usage ##

Run the following command from within the project directory

```js
   npm install
```

start node service

```js
  node bin/dev
```

point your browser to

```js
  http://localhost:4444
```

and start hacking.
